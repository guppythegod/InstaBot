# InstaBot

An Instagram bot using my favorite python library: InstaPy, completely on the command line.

No code or configurations to deal with, just install and run!

## Installation

Just run:

`pip install instabot`

and that's it!

## Using InstaBot

`$ instabot <command> <param1> <param2> <param3>`
